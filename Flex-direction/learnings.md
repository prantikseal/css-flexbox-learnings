# Working with Flexbox flex-direction

Flex direction is used to control the direction of the flex items.
The default direction is `row`, which means the flex items are laid out horizontally.

When the flexdirection is `row`, the flex items are laid out `horizontally`.
When the flexdirection is `column`, the flex items are laid out `vertically`.

The basic syntax is: `flex-direction: row/column`.
