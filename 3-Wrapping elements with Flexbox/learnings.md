# Wrapping Elements With Flexbox

In this page, we'll learn how to use flexbox to wrap elements.

We declare wrap elements in the flex container with the flex-wrap property.

- We took the flex-items and wrapped them in a flex container with a width of 300px.

- Which we can clearly say that the width of the flex elements with 300px is not enough to fit all the elements inside the container according to a usual screen size.

- This is where we use the flex-wrap property.

- The default value of flex-wrap is nowrap. And it is declared as flex-wrap: nowrap;

- The syntax is: flex-wrap: wrap;
