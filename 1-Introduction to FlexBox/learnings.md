# Introduction to FlexBox

This is the first lecture series that I am documenting here about FlexBox.

Flex Box is a layout system that allows you to lay out elements in a way that is easy to understand and easy to use.

In the html code you will see that

[]: # The container is known as the Flex-Box and the elements inside the container are the flex-items.

Syntax:
    display : flex;
    border: 10px solid goldenrod;
    height: 100vh;

we can also use inline-flex to make the border of the element inline with the divs inside the containers.

So the syntax becomes:
    display : inline-flex;
    border: 10px solid goldenrod;
    height: 100vh;

We use borders to make the elements easier to see with a border width of 10px, with the border type of solid, and the color of goldenrod.

In the height section we can use 100vh here vh means "viewport height" that is to make the height of the element equal to the height of the screen.
